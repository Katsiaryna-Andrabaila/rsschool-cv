## **Future Front-End Developer**


## **About Me**

After 25 I thought that IT is not for me, it's for younger guys. At 35 I don't care, I believe that everything is in my hands and, futhermore, in my head.

My previous experience was not related to IT, it was in insurance and estimation. But that job was tied to a particular place. Now I'd like a different type of activity and this could be Frontend Development, because it's very interesting and supposes difficult tasks. And such tasks have always been especially interesting for me - they help me feel great job satisfaction.

     }
     return count;
   };
  
  let countFinal = 0;
  for (let j = 0; j < ticket.length; j++) {
